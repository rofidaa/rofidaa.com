					on the coast. It is the Middle East’s largest aquarium and home to a dizzying array of sea life that 
					includes turtles, black-spotted sweetlips, giant spider crabs, living reefs, fluorescent jellyfish and

					shark tanks.</br>

					There are a number of impressive museums in Kuwait City, and one of the best is the National Museum.
					During the Iraqi occupation, many of the exhibition halls were damaged, burned or looted, but intense
					pressure from the international community has led to the return of many of the museum’s treasures. 
					More than 2,000 pieces are now on display, detailing various aspects of the nation’s heritage, history
					and culture. The best exhibits display ancient treasures found on Failaka Island and Hellenistic
					limestone carvings.</br>

					Jaipur enamels, inlaid musical instruments, Nepalese necklaces, Omani silver, Bahraini pearls and more.</br>
					5. Al-Qurain Martyrs’ Museum</br>
					One of the most moving spaces in the city is the Al-Qurain Martyrs’ Museum. The small museum is a memorial to not just the patriots but also to the other Kuwait City families who suffered during the Iraqi occupation.
					Other places worth visiting in the capital include the Al-Hashemi Marine Museum, the quirky House of Mirrors, the famous Kuwait Towers, the Beit Dickson, home of British agent Colonel Harold Dickson, the extensive Corniche with its 10 kilometers of beaches, paths and parks, the Popular Traditional Museum and the Grand Mosque, the biggest of the capital’s more than 800 mosques.
