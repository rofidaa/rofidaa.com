					 the GDPs of all but 11 and 12 countries, respectively.</br>
					New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by 
					colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626.</br> The city and its surroundings 
					came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England 
					granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.</br> New York served as the capital of 
					the United States from 1785 until 1790.
					It has been the country's largest city since 1790.</br>
					The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the
					late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy.</br>
					In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship,
					social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, and as a world symbol of freedom and 
					cultural diversity.</br>
					Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received
					a record 61 million tourists in 2016, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist 
					attractions in 2013.</br>Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world.
					</br>Times Square, iconic as the world's "heart" and its "Crossroads", is the brightly illuminated hub 
					of the Broadway Theater District,one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major 
					center of the world's entertainment industry.</br> The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered
					skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world.</br> Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial 
					District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful
					city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to 
					the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, 
					the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.</br> Manhattan's real estate market is
					among the most expensive in the world.</br> Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates
					the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere,
					with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city.</br> Providing continuous 24/7 service,
				    the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 472 stations in 
					operation. Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, 
					including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, 
					which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.
